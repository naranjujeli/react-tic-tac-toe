# First React project: Tic Tac Toe Game

This project consists of a simple Tic Tac Toe game developed in order to learn the basics of the ReactJS Framework, such as:
- The creation and use of **Components**
- The creation and use of **Event Handlers**
- The use of **props**
- The use of the **State Hook**
The repository represents the beginning of my journey learning this SSR tool with the purpose of using it in future web projects.
